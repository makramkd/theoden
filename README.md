## Theoden

My intention is for this to be a shared library that exports exports various 
abstract data types:

* Stack
* Queue
* Dictionary

In addition, the above are to be implemented by associated data structures:

* Variations on the linked list
* Binary trees and their balanced counterparts
* Binary heaps and other heap structures
* B-trees and their variations
* Other miscellaneous tree structures (prefix/suffix trees, interval trees, splay trees)

This is also intended as an educational exercise and something to do in my free time. So
most likely the code will not be optimized to the last instruction.
